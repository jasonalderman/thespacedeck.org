# Instructions
1. Work with a partner and select a leader and a follower.
2. Blindfold the follower (or ask them to close their eyes).
3. Hold hands. As the leader, guide the follower through the space. Use verbal descriptions to share your personal perspective on what you see.
4. Switch roles and repeat.
