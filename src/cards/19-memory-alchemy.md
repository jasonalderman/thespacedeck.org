# Instructions
1. Choose/find an object of personal significance or attachment.
2. Transform it into a new creative expression or language (i.e. write a story, make up a dance, sing a song, or take a photograph). 

# Consider
- Letting the physical object go (throw it away/recycle/give it away).
- Sharing your creative expression with others.
