# Instructions

1. Notice oppressive or bigoted comments in your immediate surroundings (i.e. racism, sexism, classism, or homophobia).
2. Don't let it pass. Decide how to approach the situation. 
3. Immediately address it.
4. Share how the comment makes you feel.

# Consider
Asking a question. Or starting a conversation. Or suggesting a resource or reference that provides a positive context around the oppressive or bigoted comment.
