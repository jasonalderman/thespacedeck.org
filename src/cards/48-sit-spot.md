# Instructions
1. Find a space outside where you can hear both natural and man-made sounds.
2. Remain still, close your eyes, and sit comfortably.
3. Listen.
4. Reflect on the contrast of the natural and man-made sounds.

# Consider 
How many sounds did you hear? How many were loud? Soft? Clear? Appealing? Annoying?
