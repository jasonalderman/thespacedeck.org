# Instructions
1. Acknowledge when you're feeling scared and decide if you can push yourself through the fear.
2. If not, keep trying to find that strength.
3. If you can, write about the experience. Include the moment you realized you were afraid and how you acted courageously. 
4. End your record by describing the outcome of your courage.
5. Save these entries in a box or drawer. When you need inspiration or strength, look inside your archive of courage.

# Consider
Celebrate every courageous act, even the small ones.
