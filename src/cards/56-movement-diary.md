# Instructions
1. Create a motion to represent each hour that passes throughout your day.
2. Each hour, perform the motions that represent your day so far, adding the new motion to the end of the sequence. Repeat until the end of your day. (Record if needed.)
3. Reflect on your movements of the day. What patterns do you notice? How does it make you feel?

# Consider
Group Bonus: Encourage a friend to keep their own movement diary. Compare at the end of the day. Discuss similarities and differences.
