# Instructions
Employ any of these strategies to get a sense of how people are doing:
1. Fist to Five (best for 5+ people): Each person physically displays their comfort-level using their hand. Fist = Entirely Negative. Five Fingers = Entirely Positive.
2. Post-it Truths: Each person writes a brief, anonymous reflection (i.e. concerns or affirmations) on a single post-it. The notes can be posted on a wall or collected by a facilitator and read aloud.
