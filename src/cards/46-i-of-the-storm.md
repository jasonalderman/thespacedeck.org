# Instructions
1. Find a place during your day that is chaotic, loud, or distracting (i.e. work, grocery store, or subway station).
2. Stop somewhere in the midst of the noise or chaos and stand still for one minute.
3. Breathe deeply.
4. Repeat often and for increasing lengths of time. Build up to five minutes if you can.
