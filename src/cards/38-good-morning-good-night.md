# Instructions
1. Observe and record your morning and evening habits for one week. For example, do you look at your phone first thing in the morning?
2. Identify one unwanted habit and replace it with a beneficial ritual.
3. Practice this new ritual for one week.
4. Reflect on this change. Is it something that you want to continue? Are there other unwanted habits you want to replace?
