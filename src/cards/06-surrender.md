# Instructions

1. Pick a problem that you have.
2. Ask yourself: is this a big problem or is this a small problem?
3. If it's a big problem, take a deep breath and seek support.
4. If it's a small problem, take a deep breath and let it go.
5. Work to change your headspace.

# Consider
Letting go may be an ongoing process.
