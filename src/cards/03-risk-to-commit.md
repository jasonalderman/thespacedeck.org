# Instructions

1. Get a pen and paper.
2. Identify the commitment you want to make. 
3. Write it down (i.e. "join the movement,", "go back to school").
4. List the pros and cons of making the commitment. 
5. Examine your lists. The answer may be clearer than you thought.

# Consider
If the pros and cons are equal, flip a coin to decide.
