# Instructions
1. Reflect on your day and identify which musical genre it would be. 
2. Turn one or more of the dayâ€™s experiences into a performance (song, dance, or both).

# Consider
Change the lyrics to a song to reflect your day or invent your own song (i.e. I ran for the B-U-S. I ate a yummy L-U-N-C-H).
