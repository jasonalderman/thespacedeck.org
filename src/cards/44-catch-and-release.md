# Time
1 to 5 minutes
# Instructions
1. Filter through the mental refuse of your day.
2. Acknowledge self-perceived mistakes, shortcomings, or negative feelings.
3. Envision throwing them out the window, flushing them down the toilet, or setting them free like a flock of doves. 

# Alternative
Follow a similar process with your physical self. Are you feeling tension, pain, soreness or stress? Focus on specific areas: toes, knees, shoulders, neck, etc.
