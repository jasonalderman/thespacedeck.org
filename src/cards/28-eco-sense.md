# Instructions
1. Focus on where you are using one or more sense: Taste, Touch, Hear, Smell, or Sight.
2. Explore a sensation you notice and imagine its journey. 
     - Where did the sensation come from? 
     - How did the sensation come to your awareness?
     - Who or what may have cultivated it?
     - What does it nurture in yourself and others?
