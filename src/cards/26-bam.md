# Instructions
Disrupt environments that need change in the following ways:
- enter a room and shout or yell
- walk into an environment and clap
- stand silently in a bustling place
- walk into an environment and disrupt space with your body by stomping, jumping, wiggling, etc.

# Example
Disrupt a meeting by starting with the phrase, "We will begin this meeting with a group stretch."
