# Instructions
Create a natural ecosystem inside and reimagine it outside. Try the following:
- flowers in your office
- dirt in your hands
- rocks as paperweights
- tree as your chair
- pine cones by computer screen
- grass between your toes
- use an hour glass with sand instead of a clock
- walk in the woods
- clouds as screensaver
- meeting by a body of water
