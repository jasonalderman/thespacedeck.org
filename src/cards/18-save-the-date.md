# Instructions
1. Sit down with your calendar. Schedule some intentional "creativity time."
2. Vary the duration (10 seconds to several hours).
3. Work on a creative project during this time. Or try to be creative in whatever you're already doing at that time in your schedule. 
4. Honor and prioritize your dates.

# Consider
- Scheduling some dates randomly (i.e. September 20th at 2:22pm) and some regularly (i.e. Mondays at 8:00am).
- Include inspirational quotes, affirmations, or goals in these reminders.
