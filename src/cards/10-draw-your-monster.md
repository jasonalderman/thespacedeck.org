# Time 
10 minutes or more

# Instructions
1. Draw your fear in the form of a monster.
2. Fold the drawing and put it aside for a period of time, but no more than 2 days.
3. After the period of time has passed, take out and unfold your drawing.
4. Focus on the fear your monster represents and embrace it. Be present with your monster. Carrying it with you won't cause you harm. 

# Consider
- You don't have to destroy your monster, but you can.
- Start with small monsters. This is an incremental exercise.
