# Instructions
1. Find one square foot of space in your home or office. 
2. Mark it as a visible, sacred, creative space.
3. Fill it with inspirational tools and/or objects (i.e. affirmations, pens, paints, photos, guitar pick, seashells, etc.).
4. Use it to think and act creatively.

# Consider
Instead of identifying a specific space, create a movable studio in a toolbox or a bag.
